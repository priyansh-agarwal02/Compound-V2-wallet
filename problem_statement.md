Problem statement - scoring compound v2 wallets.
Overview:
Zeru Finance is building an AI-powered, decentralized credit scoring system. You are provided with raw, transaction-level data from the Compound V2 protocol. Each record corresponds to a wallet interacting with the protocol through actions such as deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, and liquidation.

Your task is to develop a machine learning model that assigns a credit score between 0 and 100 to each wallet, based solely on historical transaction behavior. Higher scores indicate reliable and responsible usage; lower scores reflect risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.

Dataset:
You can access the dataset here:
Compound V2 Raw Dataset – Google Drive

Please select any 3 files with the largest sizes from the folder to ensure you’re working with a significant portion of the protocol’s activity.

Challenge Structure:
This is a self-driven, end-to-end modeling task. You are not provided with labels, predefined features, or a target column. Your responsibilities include:

Defining criteria for "good" and "bad" wallet behavior
Engineering features from raw transaction logs
Choosing and justifying your modeling approach (e.g., clustering, rule-based scoring, supervised learning)
Designing a credit scoring system that reflects behavioral quality and protocol health
Deliverables:
Methodology Document
A concise, structured explanation of your scoring logic and rationale.

Code Submission
A script or notebook that:

Loads and processes the raw data
Extracts wallet-level behavioral features
Outputs a score between 0 and 100 for each wallet
CSV Output
A file containing scores for the top 1,000 wallets (sorted by score, highest to lowest).

Wallet Analysis
A one-page document analyzing five high-scoring and five low-scoring wallets, explaining the observed patterns and their justification.

Constraints:
Do not use any pretrained models, external labeled datasets, or third-party scoring systems.
Do not use Zeru-provided code or schema definitions—derive everything independently from raw data.
Your scoring logic must be non-trivial and irreproducible without your custom code and reasoning.
Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity and originality of your methodology
Quality and creativity in feature engineering
Robustness, explainability, and consistency of the scoring model
Insightfulness of wallet behavior analysis
